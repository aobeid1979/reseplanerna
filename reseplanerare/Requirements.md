# Requirements for Simple Travel Planner

## Product Description

The Simple Travel Planner is a web application that allows users to plan their trips by adding destinations, travel periods, and activities for each destination. The purpose of this application is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for organizing their travel plans.

## Functional Requirements

1. Users can add a new trip with destination, travel period, and activities.
2. Users can view a list of existing trips.
3. Users can edit or delete an existing trip.
4. Trips are saved locally using IndexDb for all trips and LocalStorage for favorites.

## Data Storage Approach

- Trip data (destination, travel period, activities) will be stored using IndexDb for all trips and LocalStorage for all favorites due to it's simplicity and ease of implementation.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Handling data synchronization and consistency across different storage methods.
  Solution: Implement robust data management logic to ensure data integrity and consistency between LocalStorage and IndexedDB if both are used.

## Interactive Components

### Trip Form

The trip form is an interactive component that allows users to add a new trip or edit an existing one. The form includes fields for the destination, travel period, and activities. The goal of this component is to provide a user-friendly interface for entering and editing trip data.

### Trip List

The trip list is an interactive component that displays a list of existing trips. Each trip in the list includes a button for editing or deleting the trip. The goal of this component is to provide a clear and concise overview of all trips.

## Optimization Techniques

### Lazy Loading

We have implemented lazy loading of components using `next/dynamic`. This will reduce the initial load time of the application and improve performance, especially for users with slow internet connections.

## Accessibility Improvements

We have updated our HTML to be more semantic, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the content on the page. We have also ensured that all interactive elements are focusable and their role is correctly announced by screen readers. The goal of these improvements was to make our application more accessible and usable for people with disabilities.
